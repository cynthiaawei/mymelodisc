ECE243 Project @ University of Toronto

This project is part of my **Computer Systems** course at the University of Toronto, where I explored the integration of FPGA hardware and software systems. The project was developed using an FPGA board and a **NiosV/ RISC-V** processor, coded entirely in **C**. The purpose of this project was to design and implement a fully functional karaoke machine that incorporates real-time processing for audio, video, and lighting effects.
