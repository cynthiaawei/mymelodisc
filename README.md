ECE243 Project @ University of Toronto

MyMelodisc is a project we developped for our **Computer Systems** course at the **University of Toronto**, where we explored the integration of FPGA hardware and software systems. The project was developed using a DE1-SoC board and a **NiosV/ RISC-V** processor, coded entirely in **C** and **Arduino API**. For this project, we designed and implemented a fully functional karaoke machine that incorporates real-time processing for audio, video, and lighting effects.

## Design Overview

This project implements a karaoke machine using two FPGA boards. The first allows users to select and play songs, display lyrics and background animations on a Video Graphics Array (VGA) monitor, and sync LED strips to the song's bpm. 

The design choice to use 2 FPGA boards was due to many processor cycles spent on displaying VGA and the song audio, which resulted in a slightly choppy song audio. Hence, the other audio output (microphone) was implemented with another FPGA board.

## Features
- **Song Selection**: Enable song selection between five available songs using *keyboard interrupt*.
- **Lyrics and Background**: Displays customized lyrics and background animations on the VGA using an *interval timer interrupt*.
- **LED Lights**: Used an Arduino Nano to control LED strips. The Arduino connects to the FPGA using GPIO pins, allowing them to work together to change colors in sync with the songâ€™s tempo and vibe.
- **Microphone Audio**: Captures the userâ€™s voice through a microphone and outputs it to a secondary speaker.
- **Song Control**: Pause or exit the song via the spacebar or escape key. Note that this feature only works with the VGA displays and light strips and not the background audio.
  
## Future Enhancements
- Add functionality to allow the pause and escape controls to also stop background music playback.
- Add more song options.
- Implement more complex lighting effects.
- Improve background audio processing and integration.

## Demos

Demo of Pause/Escape feature with the VGA & lights. Lights turn stay on when paused and turn off when escaped.

| VGA conversions from PNG to arrays     | Cynthia                | Designed all PNG images by hand using canva, then used a Python program ([shared by a classmate]([https://github.com/Ken-2511/ECE243_ImageConverter]) to convert them to C arrays.             |
| Timer                                  | Cynthia                | Created an interrupt-driven timer that triggers at the BPM of the selected song.                                                                            |

| GPIO / Parallel Ports                  | Cynthia                | Used GPIO ports to send an enable signal from the keyboard interrupt to the LED lights.                                                                     |
| Arduino / LEDs                         | Cynthia                | Programmed LEDs to switch between two colors based on the BPM and theme of the song.                                                                        |
