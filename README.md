ECE243 Project @ University of Toronto

This project is part of my **Computer Systems** course at the University of Toronto, where I explored the integration of FPGA hardware and software systems. The project was developed using an FPGA board and a **NiosV/ RISC-V** processor, coded entirely in **C**. The purpose of this project was to design and implement a fully functional karaoke machine that incorporates real-time processing for audio, video, and lighting effects.

## My Role in the Karaoke Machine Project

My role for this project was to create the FPGA board that handled key components of the karaoke machine. I integrated the FPGA with the keyboard, enabling song selection through user input. Additionally, I implemented the escape and space bar function, which allowed users to exit or pause the song when needed. I also synchronized the lighting system (LEDs) to the beats per minute (BPM) of the song, ensuring that the lights changed at the correct speed to match the song's tempo.
